	/*	TODO SudokuBruteSolver planning
	 *  Create a 2D Array of ArrayList with possible values
	 *  Loop thru sheet and get all starting possibilities and deep copy them.
	 *  
	 *  Start a recursive loop for i between 1 -> size^2. Use ArrayLooper2D to get coordinates.
	 *  
	 *  The loop should be able to move forward and backwards and to add and remove from the possibilities
	 *  
	 *  If i == 0   throw error probably unsolvable 
	 *  If i == size^2 + 1	Sudoku is probably solved // It works in my head at least
	 *  
	 *  Make 2 functions for column, row, box = x
	 *  
	 *  Remove possibility from every x
	 *  Add possibility from every x
